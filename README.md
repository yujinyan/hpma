I love the art-style if HPMA, so I made a website for hosting pictures taken by the in-game camera.

Developed with [Gatsby.js](https://www.gatsbyjs.com), hosted on [vercel](https://vercel.com).

## 🚀 Quick start

1. **Start developing.**

   ```shell
   gatsby develop
   ```

1. **Open the source code and start editing!**

   Your site is now running at `http://localhost:8000`!

   _Note: You'll also see a second link: _`http://localhost:8000/___graphql`_. This is a tool you can use to experiment
   with querying your data. Learn more about using this tool in
   the [Gatsby Tutorial](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/docs/tutorial/part-4/#use-graphiql-to-explore-the-data-layer-and-write-graphql-queries)
   ._

## 🧐 What's inside?

A quick look at the top-level files and directories you'll see in a Gatsby project.

    .
    ├── content
    ├── node_modules
    ├── src
    ├── .gitignore
    ├── .prettierrc
    ├── gatsby-browser.js
    ├── gatsby-config.js
    ├── gatsby-node.js
    ├── gatsby-ssr.js
    ├── LICENSE
    ├── package-lock.json
    ├── package.json
    └── README.md

1. **`/content`**

3. **`/src`**: This directory will contain all of the code related to what you will see on the front-end of your site (
   what you see in the browser) such as your site header or a page template. `src` is a convention for “source code”.
4. **`/content`**: This directory will contain all of the code related to what you will see on the front-end of your
   site (what you see in the browser) such as your site header or a page template. `src` is a convention for “source
   code”.

5. **`gatsby-browser.js`**: This file is where Gatsby expects to find any usage of
   the [Gatsby browser APIs](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/docs/reference/config-files/gatsby-browser/) (if any). These allow
   customization/extension of default Gatsby settings affecting the browser.

6. **`gatsby-config.js`**: This is the main configuration file for a Gatsby site. This is where you can specify
   information about your site (metadata) like the site title and description, which Gatsby plugins you’d like to
   include, etc. (Check out the [config docs](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/docs/reference/config-files/gatsby-config/) for
   more detail).

7. **`gatsby-node.js`**: This file is where Gatsby expects to find any usage of
   the [Gatsby Node APIs](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/docs/reference/config-files/gatsby-node/) (if any). These allow
   customization/extension of default Gatsby settings affecting pieces of the site build process.

8. **`gatsby-ssr.js`**: This file is where Gatsby expects to find any usage of
   the [Gatsby server-side rendering APIs](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/docs/reference/config-files/gatsby-ssr/) (if any).
   These allow customization of default Gatsby settings affecting server-side rendering.
